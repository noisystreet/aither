/* This class implements a k-d tree for the purpose of efficiently performing
a nearest neighbor search. The search is used to find the minimum distance of
all cells to a viscous wall. The coordinates of cell faces contacting a 
viscous wall are stored in the data structure in the nodes_ variable. When
the tree is built the nodes are reordered such that a tree branch to the left
is the next indice down, and the index of a tree branch to the right is 
stored in the right_ variable. A simple 2D example will be shown to explain
how the data is ordered.

Given a set of points: (7,1), (0,2), (5,4), (3,9), (2,7), (8,6), (1,3), 
(6,5), (4,0), (9,8)

Using a bin size of 2, the k-d tree would look like the following:

Root                         (4,0)
                            /     \
Split - X                (1,3)   (6,5)
                        /    \    /   \
Split - Y           (0,2) (2,7) (7,1) (8,6)
                          (3,9) (5,4) (9,8)

This tree would be stored in the nodes_ and right_ vectors in the following
way:
nodes_ = [(4,0), (1,3), (0,2), (2,7), (3,9), (6,5), (7,1), (5,4), (8,6), (9.8)]
right_ = [  5,     3,    -1,    -1     -1,     8,    -1,    -1,    -1,    -1  ]

To traverse the tree, the branch to the left is given by the next indice in 
the nodes_ vector. For example point (1,3) is at index 1, and its left branch
is at index 2. The branch to the right is given by the right_ vector. For
example at point (1,3) is at index 1, its right branch is given by the
corresponding value at index 1 in the right_ vector. In this case its right
branch is at index 3.
